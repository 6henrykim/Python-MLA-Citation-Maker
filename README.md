# Python MLA Citation Maker
This is a script to make MLA format citations from an Excel spreadsheet and save them in a Word document.
I created this personal project as an alternative to using ad-filled websites.
For handling the files I used the python-docx, openpyxl, and tkinter Python libraries.
